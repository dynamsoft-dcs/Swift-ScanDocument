# Swift-ScanDocument
This sample demonstrates how to use Dynamsoft Camera SDK on mobile devices to automatically detect a document from live video streams and then capture it by a simple click. Once captured, the document can be rotated or have its brightness or contrast adjusted. Users can also manually adjust the documents' edges should the detection failed to do its job.
